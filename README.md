| Hypothesis | Mean True Effect Size | Significance Level | Heterogeneity (I^2) |
|------------|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Performance (H1) | 0.149 | p<0.10 | 63% |
| Inter-role Conflict (H2a) | -0.072 | p<0.01 | 89% |
| Exhaustion (H2b) | -0.298 | p<0.05 | 79% |
| Life Satisfaction (H2c) | 0.314 | p<0.10 | Not Provided |
| Organizational Commitment (H3) | 0.22 | p<0.10 | Not Provided |
| Job Satisfaction (H4) | 0.188 | p<0.01 | 90% |

## Comments

- The mean true effect sizes indicate the magnitude of the effect autonomy has on various outcomes related to remote work.
- Significance levels suggest the statistical confidence in these effects, with p<0.05 typically considered statistically significant.
- Heterogeneity (I^2) values provide insight into the variability among study results included in the meta-analysis.
