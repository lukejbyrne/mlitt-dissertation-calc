## "How To Motivate Remote Employees: A Self-Determination Theory Perspective"

The dissertation employed meta-analysis to synthesize existing research on the impact of autonomy on remote employees' motivation, utilizing the Hedges and colleagues method for its ability to handle diverse study outcomes. Through fixed- and random-effects models, it calculated weighted averages of effect sizes and assessed study consistency, addressing both within-study and between-study variances. The analysis revealed significant effects of autonomy on various aspects of remote work, including performance, inter-role conflict, exhaustion, life satisfaction, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction, with varying levels of statistical significance and study outcome heterogeneity. These findings highlight the importance of autonomy in enhancing remote employees' motivation and work-related outcomes, as evidenced by mean true effect sizes, significance levels, and heterogeneity measures.

## What is Meta-Analysis?
Meta-analysis is a statistical technique used to combine the findings from independent studies to identify patterns, discrepancies, and overall effects across numerous research studies. It goes beyond mere literature review by conducting secondary statistical analysis on the outcomes of relevant studies.
## Why Use Meta-Analysis?
The author chose meta-analysis to systematically review and synthesize existing research on how autonomy impacts remote employees' motivation. This method allows for a comprehensive examination of the collected data, identifying general consensus points, conflicts, and the reliability of the compared studies. It's particularly suited to the dissertation's goal due to the abundance of existing research on Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and its application to remote work environments.
## The Selected Approach
Among various meta-analysis methods, the dissertation utilizes the Hedges and colleagues method, which offers both fixed- and random-effects models. This approach was chosen for its ability to handle the nuances of the studies analyzed, especially considering the potential for diverse outcomes in studies related to autonomy and remote work.
## Statistical Implementation
### Fixed-Effects Meta-Analysis
The method begins by converting effect sizes into a standard normal metric via Fisher’s r-to-Z transformation, then calculating a weighted average of these transformed scores.
### Calculating Homogeneity of Effect Sizes
It involves assessing the consistency among study outcomes to ensure they are evaluating the same effect. Homogeneity tests such as Cochrane’s Q statistic and I^2 are employed to examine between-study variance.
### Random-Effects Meta-Analysis
This part calculates the mean effect size, incorporating both within-study and between-study variances, to address the heterogeneity among studies.

## Hypotheses and Results

| Hypothesis | Mean True Effect Size | Significance Level | Heterogeneity (I^2) |
|------------|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Performance (H1) | 0.149 | p<0.10 | 63% |
| Inter-role Conflict (H2a) | -0.072 | p<0.01 | 89% |
| Exhaustion (H2b) | -0.298 | p<0.05 | 79% |
| Life Satisfaction (H2c) | 0.314 | p<0.10 | Not Provided |
| Organizational Commitment (H3) | 0.22 | p<0.10 | Not Provided |
| Job Satisfaction (H4) | 0.188 | p<0.01 | 90% |

## Comments

- The mean true effect sizes indicate the magnitude of the effect autonomy has on various outcomes related to remote work.
- Significance levels suggest the statistical confidence in these effects, with p<0.05 typically considered statistically significant.
- Heterogeneity (I^2) values provide insight into the variability among study results included in the meta-analysis.

## Results

The meta-analysis revealed statistically significant correlations between autonomy and various outcomes (job performance, life satisfaction, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction), supporting the hypotheses derived from SDT. It also identified telecommuting intensity as a moderating factor, affecting the strength of these relationships. However, there were anomalies in performance, inter-role conflict, and job satisfaction outcomes, suggesting that while autonomy generally improves these aspects, the effect sizes and significance levels vary across studies.
